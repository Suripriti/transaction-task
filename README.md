Transactions Data Analysis 
Project Overview

This project analyzes a transactions dataset to derive insights about sales, revenue, customer behavior, and service trends. The raw dataset initially contained inconsistencies, missing values, and incorrect data types, which required data cleaning and preprocessing before performing meaningful analysis.

The main objectives of this analysis are:

Identify the highest revenue-generating products/services and regions.

Determine sales trends over time.

Analyze customer behavior, including average transactions per customer.

Detect services where customers spend significantly more.

Prepare the data for visualizations and business decision support.
